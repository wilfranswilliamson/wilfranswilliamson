My main field of study is programming but I need to mention I also find very interesting mathematics and physics. In the programming world, my passions are game programming and artificial intelligence but I have no problem at all creating other types of software not related to my aforementioned passions. I'm open to work remotely (worldwide) so, feel free to contact me, hopefully we can build great things together.
